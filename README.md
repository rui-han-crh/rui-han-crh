### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and a video game developer. My expertise is writing a large of maintainable code - I just really like programming - and making digital products look pretty and personal.

In addition, I am very familiar with video game development, specifically organisational structure of programmable components to retain reusablity and low coupling.

In my free time, I draw anime-style art. Check out my art gallery on Instagram [@nebvis_art](https://instagram.com/nebvis_art?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).

Take a look at my pinned section for the available public showcase of my work. Click into each repository to see a preview of the program.

For business opportunities, please contact me using the email in my profile.

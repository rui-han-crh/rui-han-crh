### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and a video game developer. My expertise is writing a large of maintainable code - I just really like programming - and making digital products look pretty and personal.

In addition, I am very familiar with video game development, specifically organisational structure of programmable components to retain reusablity and low coupling. In addition, I love visual design in computer games and graphics!

In my free time, I draw anime-style art. Check out my art gallery on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nebvis_art/" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Instagram_logo_2016.svg/1024px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg.png" height="15"/> @nebvis_art!</a>.

Take a look at my pinned section for the showcase of my publically available work. Click into each repository to see a preview of the program. I am unfortunately unable to provide any showcase for work I have done for private companies due to reasons involving property ownership.

For business opportunities, please contact me using the email in my profile.
